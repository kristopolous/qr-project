2x3 sticker sheets getting programmatically created from a variety of inputs and generated as PDFs for download.

Eventually this will be a user-configurable system through the website and something flexible enough to grab hundreds of images.

However, right now there's still build-out and some manual things.

I don't know *how* many sheets have been printed or sticker distributed ... but I should probably start tracking that.

It's probably about 150 stickers as of May 23, 2016.

Silent, quiet, polite and gentle revolutionary acts for a better tomorrow.
