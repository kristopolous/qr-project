<h1>Aunt Helen</h1><h2>TS Eliot</h2></span><span><p>Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,<br>And lived in a small house near a fashionable square<br>Cared for by servants to the number of four.<br>Now when she died there was silence in heaven<br>And silence at her end of the street.<br>The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet&mdash;<br>He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.<br>The dogs were handsomely provided for,<br>But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.<br>The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,<br>And the footman sat upon the dining-table<br>Holding the second housemaid on his knees&mdash;<br>Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.</p>
