<h1>Sonnet 138</h1><h2>William Shakespeare</h2></span><span><p>When my love swears that she is made of truth<br>I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>That she might think me some untutor'd youth,<br>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.<br>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:<br>On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.<br>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,<br>And age in love loves not to have years told:<br>Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<br>And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</p>
