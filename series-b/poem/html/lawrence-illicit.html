<h1>Illicit</h1><h2>DH Lawrence</h2><span class="first"><p>In front of the sombre mountains, a faint, lost ribbon of rainbow,<br>And between us and it, the thunder;<br>And down below, in the green wheat, the labourers<br>Stand like dark stumps, still in the green wheat.</p><p>You are near to me, and your naked feet in their sandals,<br>And through the scent of the balcony's naked timber<br>I distinguish the scent of your hair; so now the limber</p></span><span><p>Lightning falls from heaven.</p><p>Adown the pale-green, glacier-river floats<br>A dark boat through the gloom&mdash;and whither?<br>The thunder roars. But still we have each other.<br>The naked lightnings in the heaven dither<br>And disappear. What have we but each other?<br>The boat has gone.</p></span>
