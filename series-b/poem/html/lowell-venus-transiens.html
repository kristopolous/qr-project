<h1>Venus Transiens</h1><h2>Amy Lowell</h2><span class="first"><p>Tell me,<br>Was Venus more beautiful<br>Than you are,<br>When she topped<br>The crinkled waves,<br>Drifting shoreward<br>On her plaited shell?<br>Was Botticelli's vision<br>Fairer than mine;<br>And were the painted rosebuds<br>He tossed his lady,<br>Of better worth</p></span><span><p>Than the words I blow about you<br>To cover your too great loveliness<br>As with a gauze<br>Of misted silver?</p><p>For me,<br>You stand poised<br>In the blue and buoyant air,<br>Cinctured by bright winds,<br>Treading the sunlight.<br>And the waves which precede you<br>Ripple and stir<br>The sands at my feet.</p></span>
