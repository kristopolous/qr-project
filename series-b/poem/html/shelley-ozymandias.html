<h1>Ozymandias</h1><h2>Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2></span><span><p>I met a traveller from an antique land<br>Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>Stand in the desert &hellip; Near them, on the sand,<br>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:<br>And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'<br>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
