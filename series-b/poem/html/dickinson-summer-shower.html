<h1>Summer Shower</h1><h2>Emily Dickinson</h2><span class="first"><p>A drop fell on the apple tree,<br>Another on the roof;<br>A half a dozen kissed the eaves,<br>And made the gables laugh.</p><p>A few went out to help the brook,<br>That went to help the sea.<br>Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,<br>What necklaces could be!</p></span><span><p>The dust replaced in hoisted roads,<br>The birds jocoser sung;<br>The sunshine threw his hat away,<br>The orchards spangles hung.</p><p>The breezes brought dejected lutes,<br>And bathed them in the glee;<br>The East put out a single flag,<br>And signed the fete away.</p></span>
