<h1>Fire and Ice</h1><h2>Robert Frost</h2></span><span><p>SOME say the world will end in fire<br>Some say in ice.<br>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>I hold with those who favor fire.<br>But if it had to perish twice,<br>I think I know enough of hate<br>To know that for destruction ice<br>Is also great<br>And would suffice.</p>
