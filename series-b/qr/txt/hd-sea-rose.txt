Sea Rose
Hilda Doolittle (HD)

Rose, harsh rose,
marred and with stint of petals,
meagre flower, thin,
sparse of leaf.

more precious
than a wet rose,
single on a stem&mdash;
you are caught in the drift.

Stunted, with small leaf,
you are flung on the sands,
you are lifted
in the crisp sand
that drives in the wind.

Can the spice-rose
drip such acrid fragrance
hardened in a leaf?
