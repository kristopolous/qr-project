Southern Sunrise
Sylvia Plath

  Color of lemon, mango, peach,
  These storybook villas
  Still dream behind
  Shutters, their balconies
  Fine as hand-
  Made lace, or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch.
  Tilting with the winds,
  On arrowy stems,
  Pineapple-barked,
  A green crescent of palms
  Sends up its forked
  Firework of fronds.
  A quartz-clear dawn
  Inch by bright inch
  Gilds all our Avenue,
  And out of the blue drench
  Of Angels' Bay
  Rises the round red watermelon sun.
