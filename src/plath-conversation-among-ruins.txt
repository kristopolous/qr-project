Conversation Among The Ruins
Sylvia Plath

  Through portico of my elegant house you stalk
  With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit
  And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net
  Of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back.
  Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak
  Above the appalling ruin; in bleak light
  Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight
  Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break.
  Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock;
  While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit
  Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot,
  Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic:
  With such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,
  What ceremony of words can patch the havoc ?
  Winter Landscape, with Rooks
  Water in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
  plunges headlong into that black pond
  where, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan
  floats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind
  which hungers to haul the white reflection down.
  The austere sun descends above the fen,
  an orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look
  longer on this landscape of chagrin;
  feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,
  brooding as the winter night comes on.
